			`A 32-year-old freelance web designer & developer. I'm also a Sheffield United supporter, Tech-Geek and Star Wars megafan. I like to work on all things web, from UI/UX design to full-stack development.`,
			`Freelancing is not my full time gig, I work as part of the management team for one of the UK's largest taxi companies, ensuring we are at the cutting edge of technology and our business is optimised to work in the most effcient way possible. so that is why you will notice a theme of most of my projects being with the transport/logistics/taxi industry but i can work with all industries`,
			`I'm fiercely dedicated to achieving success with everything i am involed with, pushing boundaries along the way.`,
			`In my spare time, I'm often found being crazy with my two daughters and the dog, either that or I'm shut in a dark room watching too much youtube of probably football highlights.`,
