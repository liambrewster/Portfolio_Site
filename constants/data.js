			`A 32-year-old freelance web designer & developer. I'm also a Sheffield United supporter, Tech-Geek and Star Wars megafan. I like to work on all things web, from UI/UX design to full-stack development.`,
			`Freelancing is not my full time gig, I work as part of the management team for one of the UK's largest taxi companies, ensuring we are at the cutting edge of technology and our business is optimised to work in the most effcient way possible. so that is why you will notice a theme of most of my projects being with the transport/logistics/taxi industry but i can work with all industries`,
			`I'm fiercely dedicated to designing the best websites I possibly can for clients like you, websites that not only look beautiful but leave your competitors in the dust and help your business grow.`,
			`In my spare time, I'm often found being crazy with my two daughters and the dog, either that or I'm shut in a dark room watching too much youtube of probably football highlights.`,

			`I've been developing full-stack application since I was 10 years old. I didn't know what full-stack meant at that time because the term was not coined back then. I'm so out of content right now that I'm literally crying writing this text since lorem text is so 2012 now.`,
			`After learning HTML and struggling with CSS, I came up with a brilliant idea of using bootstrap so that I don't have to style everything by myself and - for obvious reasons - if you knew bootstrap, you were cool.`,
			`But now, I'm a legend. I've been coding in React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, Express, Fastify, MongoDB, MySQL, Bootstrap, Tailwind, C, C++, C#, Rust, Haskell, Perl, PHP, Assembly, Logo and YouDontKnowShit programming language etc to name a few. Although I barely know the syntax (Psst, Stack overflow!), I consider myself a Ninja developer I'm laughing right now.`,
